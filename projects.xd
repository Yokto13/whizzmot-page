	[app Connect Neurons; connectneurons;
		A game in which you will practice your logical thinking.
		Your task is to connect neurons in a way that the number of connections of each neuron equals its value.
		But be careful [---] no two connections can intersect.
		We wrote this a long time ago in Xamarin and C#.
	]
	[app Grand Historian; grandhistorian;
		A quiz where you can test your knowledge of history in different areas [---]
		ranging from Ancient Greece to the Second World War!
		This was our first Flutter project. The app is far from perfect, but the questions are great, mostly thanks
		to our friend Tomáš Lávička who spent a lot of time coming up with most of them.
	]
	[app Old-school Snake; snake;
		An arcade game in which you play as a snake and your task is to eat food
		and grow in length as much as you can.
		This was again written a long long time ago using Xamarin and C#.

[section IYPT 19/20;
	Together with Ondra Baštař and Viki Valdmanová we attended the Czech round of
	the International Young Physicists Tournament 2019/20.
	There was no tradition of IYPT on our highschool and we had hard time figuring out
	how a great solution should be structured.
	That's why we share our solutions to two of the problems.
	So anybody interested can read them and learn from them.
	[# TODO: add the links]
	Those solutions were recieved well although in the end didn't win the first place.
